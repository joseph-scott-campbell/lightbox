# lightbox

Code for my [lightbox project](https://scott.nopreserveroot.xyz/posts/lightbox-1/). A box with etched acrylic that is illuminated according to the performance of stocks.

The code is not fully done yet, I need to finish implementing a web interface to change what stock each slot correponds to.
