his was a project for school and the code will no longer be maintained. It will most likely continue to work, but there are no guarantees.

These are all the files relating to my [lightbox project](https://scott.nopreserveroot.xyz/tags/lightbox/). This takes data from the yahoo finance API and displays the data through the color that different acrylic panels are illuminated in.

This all runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython.

On the final project I decoupaged newspaper onto the body, but it is not necessary if you are going to make it yourself.
